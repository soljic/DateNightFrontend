	"hero_title": "Spiritus exists because of a song. A folk song about an ordinary and modest man called Andrija Čordaš.",
	"hero_story": "Andrija Čordaš was a farmer who lived after WW2 in rural Croatia. He was a humble person who had a loving wife, a few farm animals, and a flute that he adored playing. He dedicated his life to simple beauties and never cared about riches. He died early and several people went to his funeral. That should've been the end of his story.\n\nBut, Andrija had one friend.\n\nHis friend was a poet who loved his life. He wrote a poem about his simple, rural, and beautiful life. When he published the poem, members of the most famous Croatian folk band decided to make a song out of it. The song was called “Story of Andrija Čordaš“. The song became one of the most famous Croatian folk songs of all time.\n\nImagine, a song about a person that had the simplest life became legendary! Founding members of Spiritus saw a huge problem and a beautiful opportunity.\n\nHow many people have a friend who is a poet? Almost none. How many people with beautiful life stories are forgotten? Almost everyone.\n\nAlmost every human being that ever lived is forgotten they never existed.\n\nWe don’t know anything about them. What was their passion, what they did, or even what was their name...",
